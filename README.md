# CUNY Dissertations Scraper

This is a web scraper that uses Node. js. It is built to scrape and organize the basic information about dissertation summaries published on the [CUNY Graduate Center Website](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/GC-Header/Alumni/Alumni-Dissertations-and-Theses).

This scrapes the information in the summaries and inserts it into a database using SQL. It requires MySQL Workbench, MAMP and Node.js to run.
